- How do you run tests?: extant tests are now obsolete as of failed attempts to refactor using queues as of lab 13.
- Any tests of note?: All tests used to pass, until the refactoring for message queueing for lab 13.
- Describe any tests that you did not complete, that skipped, and etc: All of them, for now. Let's hope I'll get back to this app after the demo.
